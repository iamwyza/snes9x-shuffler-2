# NOTICE - WIP
* This is still a work in progress. I think it's working, but I wouldn't trust it reliably yet.  Also a new version of SNES9x-rr will be required.  Need to go through the process of getting that PRed back to the main repo.



# Info
* [tested on Bizhawk vSNES9x-rr 1.61 - custom version to support the necessary rom and memory methods](https://github.com/iamwyza/snes9x-rr/releases/tag/1.61)
